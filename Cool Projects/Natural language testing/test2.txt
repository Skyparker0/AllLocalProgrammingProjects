federalists get free parking and go to jail for walking in certain places
Sky_Park01/13/2021
(Credit to my dad
For helpin’ make this rap less bad)
RAP GOES HERE:

We don’t need the constitution
To restrict our institutions-
Just because they didn’t write it
Doesn’t mean we need to fight it

Your strict interpretation
Isn’t best to serve our nation
Even though it isn’t written
Doesn’t make a thing forbidden

For economic stability,
We need to improve our credibility
To think about finance
And pay our debts to france

To strengthen our economy,
I use what’s right in fron’a me
A solution, I propose,
Federal taxes be imposed
To fund a national bank
Our government would thank

You say the constitution
Don't say to make that bank
Which would improve our economic rank.
But this country that we’re creatin’
Needs real decision makin’
Not based on absent rules
We need to use our thinking tools.

If we really want the whole
To be greater than the sum
Of its parts
Better start
At the top

For the core
To be strong
And last long
State power must be sent
To a central government

Divided we are weak
Don't speak
of the meek
splintered states
that will never ever make
what can truly be great.

Shared power resides
In a country without divides
And together we can make
A complete United States.

Our economy should run on
Trading,
And creating.
We must advance
In finance.

What you want is agriculture
And nothing but it.
That won’t cut it.
Our economy needs something more advanced
It needs something more than just growing plants!
This took me almost four hours to make
But hey, It's pretty good
SirSandman01/13/2021
nice
better than what I have
SirSandman01/14/2021
I think I pulled something during PE class.

Sky_Park01/14/2021

SirSandman01/14/2021

I either bent in a wierd way or a muscel in my neck was torn
Sky_Park01/14/2021

Sky_ParkToday at 1:47 PM

SirSandmanToday at 1:49 PM
I guess that would count
