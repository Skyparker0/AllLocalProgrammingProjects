Chapter one- The Cheesy opening

Little Timmy was in his kitchen. Actually he was running around his house so fast, that he was in the kitchen and the living room at the same time (they were on opposite sides of the house). Timmy practically materialized in the kitchen. “Mawmy?” he asked. “Yes honey?” she responded. “Eating sugar,” asked Timmy. “N-No Timmy, please stop being cliche.'' Timmy randomly screeched, then stopped. “Mawm, I’m gonna go for a walk with my imaginary friend!” Timmy said. “Hehehe '' said the imaginary friend “I’m going to get you ki- I mean, hi!”. Timmy’s mom went to the fridge “o-ok, you might get hungry, take this [it is dangerous to go alone.]” Timmy’s mom handed him a fresh piece of Sargento, All-American Cheese. “MMMMM, Yom!!” Timmy exclaimed and ran out the door. Timmy reached where the sidewalk ends. He looked left, Then he looked left,  and crossed the road. A car came from the left and hit Timmy. The cheese flew out of his hand and landed on the windshield
    The man in the car kept driving and said “W0W OMG THAT CH3ESE 1S L39enDARy” calmly and reached for the cheese through his windshield. He collided with another car that, too, wanted the legendary cheese slice. The man in the first car ran out of his car to get the cheese. The man in the other car said “oooh, you little cheater” and ran out of his car. News reporters reported the fight on the two cars. The two cars had collided head-to-head and the drivers were fighting over the cheese on both hoods. The cops showed up and shot the two drivers without hesitation and grabbed the cheese. The swat team also showed up and used deadly [the]  force and made the cops float into the air using their minds. “The cheese must be kept in a safe place from humanity.” said the chief of the FBI, who came in to assist the SWAT team. 
    A kids show network had made a show to encourage kids to help cheese by brainwashing them. The cartoon showed a smiley emoji with a “thinking cap” on its head. “You want the cheese,” said the show “You deserve the cheese, you desire the cheese, you need the cheese, you demand the cheese,  you require the cheese, you necessitate the cheese.” It went on for hours until kids walked out the door mindlessly while chanting what was just said on the show
Then, bullets rained from the sky. Everyone at the scene collapsed to the floor and the president in his helicopter hovered above the scene “The cheese is top secret stuff. If enemy territory gets their hands on it, things are gonna get huuuuuuge.” He said, The helicopter exploded suddenly and the cheese flew in the air and landed in the wrong hands.
    In a plane was Russian president Vladamir Putin holding a detonator for the bomb and the cheese. “This cheese is-'' The plane could not hover in mid-air and fly forward, then turned around. “Is top secret mil-” VRRRR the plane flew off again but came back “Military propert-” BOOM! The plane exploded due to a nuclear warhead falling on it. The president of North Korea was in an attack chopper. “This cheese is in our hands! We will use it to destroy you filthy people!” the president said. Everyone gasped. Peace was restored after someone in a jetpack impaled the helicopter, causing it to self-destruct. It was Big Bird. He had a scarred eye and metal-tipped feathers. He also had the cheese in his hand. He was about to land but with an “oh fiddlesticks' ', he dropped the cheese on accident. It hit the floor with a plop and was taken to the ER immediately. 
    Fan and donors visited the cheese in his stroller-sized hospital bed. They gave him flowers and chocolates that smelled of cheese. The Cheese had only just recovered when something insane happened. One lonely night, a mafia man breached the hospital and killed the receptionist. AAAAHH! The cheese was kidnapped. 
When he woke up, he was tied to a chair. A voice was heard saying something in the distance. It was the mafia man. “Alright cheese.” he said, pulling out a gun “show me da cheddar”. The cheese had no money on him, he left his wallet in the Sargento packet. “Oh yeah? Well somebody has to pay up. He picked up the cheese and walked to a conveyor belt. “Show me money or I’ll make you do this all over again. The cheese had no dough on him. “I guess it has to be this way,” Mafia man said, and threw The Cheese onto the conveyor belt.
    After a long hall of darkness, The Cheese was in the packet again. “Where is Timmy?” cried Timmy’s mother. “What the beep?” she asked, waking to the conveyor belt. “Is this the cheese Timmy had?” she asked herself. A rip in the space-time continuum opened under Timmy’s mom, causing her to fall. She landed back in her house. Timmy walked up to her. “Mawn?” he asked. Timmy’s mom gave Timmy the cheese. Her brain had been reset, but the Cheese’s brain was not.

Chapter two- Switching things up

After going through the same interdimensional loop over 100,000,000 times, The Cheese was getting bored. He had memorized everybody’s lines. On his 100,000,000,000,000th Time around, he wanted to do something different. Timmy stepped into the asphalt street. The car came from the left. The Cheese opened a portal to an alternate dimension called FLORIDA in front of it. “WOWOW!” said Timmy. The imaginary friend ran off. “Come on, let's get out of here,” Cheese said. Those were his first words.
    The cheese had teleported him and Timmy to some weird dimension. “Where are we now?” Timmy asked. “I have no Idea” Cheese replied. Grass and dirt had been organized into individual cubes that made up the vast landscape. A cow-looking animal made out of cubes slowly walked by. “MMMM YUMMY!” Timmy said and chased after the cow. The Cheese watched in horror. Timmy caught up and tackled the cow. After a moment of silence, Timmy began rubbing the cow’s belly. “Aawww, who’s a good boy?” The Cheese sighed with relief. “That's not a dog, Timmy.” Cheese said, “Also, all cows are Female”. Then Timmy helped the cow get back up, and pulled out a bucket. Timmy began milking the cow. “NOOOO! NOT THE DAIRY!!” Cheese shouted as if someone he knew just died. When Timmy was finished, The cow trotted off and the sky began to shift to nighttime.
    In the distance, green, odd-shaped figures stood around on a hill. Curious, Timmy and The Cheese approach them. “Who are dose guys?” Timmy asked The Cheese. “I don’t know, but they are kind of ominous. What should we call them?” Cheese replied. Timmy Then shouted “OOH OOH! I KNOW! LET’S CALL THEM CREEPERS!!”. This caught the creeper’s attention and they began to give chase. Timmy ran… towards the creepers. “Timmy! No!” yelled the cheese, but Timmy did not stop. “Shove it, kid!” hissed a creeper while pushing past Timmy. They wanted the legendary cheese.    The creepers hissed and slowly approached a cornered Cheese.  One of them began to 
expand in thiccness, preparing to explode. Suddenly, with the swipe of a blade to the creeper’s necks, they fell on the floor and disappeared into mist and ashes. “I founded dis,” said Timmy, Holding up a blue sword. The Cheese sighed with relief and teleported him and Timmy to a new dimension. 
They were in a large corridor made of purple bricks. The place seemed pretty old. Timmy and The Cheese progressed through the abandoned ruins. They came across a house. In the house was a pie. “MMMM YOM!” said Timmy and ate the pie whole. Screaming was heard from downstairs in the basement. The two went down but saw nothing but the dead body of an anthropomorphic goat. Cheese flopped over Timmy's eyes to blindfold him of the horrid sight. In the distance was a snowy biome. A child with a purple striped shirt was talking to a person with a blue hoodie. A girl with fox ears was hiding behind a bush. “Oh no, we have to leave Timmy.” The Cheese warned .The girl jumped out at the guy with the Hoodie. “OMG SanS MarRy me-” She was cut off after The Cheese and Timmy quickly changed dimensions.
They were in some kind of Test chamber with odd devices. Timmy saw an Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device
Sitting on a thin podium. “Yom!” Timmy says. “Please stop saying that, the portal gun is not a snack.” The Cheese said. Timmy sprinted slowly over to the portal gun. His first instinct was to fire a portal on The Cheese. He did just that. “AAAAAARGH!” The Cheese yelled like a pirate. Then Timmy fired a portal on a wall. He ran towards it. He hit the wall because he had just placed the same portal that he had previously summoned on cheese. The portal is not meant to be put on dairy products and left a hole in the middle of the cheese. Timmy put a red portal on the ceiling and a blue portal under him. He fell. He quickly appeared out of the top portal and landed back in the blue one. “AAAAAA I ‘ m  F A L L I N G!” Timmy yelled. He did not quite understand the concept of momentum. He had dropped the gun and The Cheese picked it up. He aimed and fired it at a slanted wall. Timmy flew out of the portal and over a large glass wall. The Cheese did the same, and soon… They were surrounded by turrets. “HeDdO!” Timmy said. The Turrets aimed lasers at Timmy. He started rapidly crouching and standing up. The cheese fired a portal behind Timmy and a portal behind the turrets. The turrets fired and Timmy ducked under the bullets. The bullets came out behind the turrets and shot one. The turret collapsed to the floor whilst flailing around and firing in random directions. Other turrets got hit in the process. They all eventually fell over. “SCIENCE” Timmy said, still doing the “crouch dance”. The Cheese sighed and teleported him and Timmy somewhere else.
They were in an empty grass field. There were trees, but probably not real ones. A small man was walking towards the center, where Timmy and The Cheese were standing. The little, plump humanoid was not human. It had two circular ears on the top of its head. “Hu-hu, hey everybody, it's me, Mickey mouse!” He said.  Timmy responded with“Oh..hiiiiiiya Mickey Mouse”. “SHUT UP,” Mickey yelled in a satanic voice. He then went back to his usual high pitched voice. “Say, ya wanna c o m e i n s i d e m y c l u b h o u s e?” Mickey asked, a hint of pervertedness in his voice. “O H B O Y! Y E S M I C K Y!” Timmy responded with almost equal pervertedness. “ SHUT IT, KID” Mickey Mouse said in the Satanic voice. A random voice boomed from the sky “Ay, ay, ay ay, yo”. Mickey mouse continued “I  A L M O S T  Forgot.” The voice in the sky continued skatting. “We need to say the MAJIC WERDS”. “MEESCCA, MOOSCCA, MIKKY MOWS.” As Mickey continued chanting, A town emerged from a pentagram in the ground. Mickey walked into the town. The voice in the sky began singing…

🎵Ay, Ay, Ay Ay, Yo. M-I-C-K-E-Y. Dat spell Mickey Mouse (He in da house.) DRUGS! Rowlcowl.

“Hu-hu, Mickey’s Secret”

Mickey walked into his clubhouse with his usual bouncy walk and warmly greeted the audience. “hu-hu . Hiya everybody, and welcome to my clubhouse” The kitchen light was suspiciously turned off. “Lets go to the hostage room, hu-hu.” Mickey walked over to a large red. He booped it. The kitchen then used impossible geometry to flip around twice until it reached a basement room with Timmy and The Cheese tied up. “Hoo-hoo, let's go INTERROGATE them”. 
“Duh duh duh dooooo, duh duh duh doooooo” Timmy said. “SHUT UP” Micky exclaimed. He then looked at the camera with a smile and then back at Timmy. “Mouska WHAT mouska IS mouska YOUR NAME?”. “what” Timmy responded. “WHAT IS YOUR NAME??” Mickey asked. “His name Is ti-” “SHUT UP” The Cheese tried to talk but Micky wasn’t asking him the question. “Tell me your name kid, or there’ll be CONSEQUENCES” Mickey threatened. Then Timmy said in his innocent voice: “Ur Stoopid”. Mickey was now deeply annoyed. “RRRAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!” He screamed, then looked at the camera. “Hu-hu, looks like we’re gonna have to get toodles, WON’T WE?”. Goofy and Donald walked into the room as ominous music starts to play. “OOOOH TOODLES!” they all, including Timmy, said in unison. Toodles went behind mickey. “Now where is toodles?” Mickey asked as he turned around. Toodles stayed behind mickeys head. “I can’t seem to find hi- GOTCHA”. He faked out and turned around before toodles could go back behind mickeys head. Mickey grabbed toodles and said, “NOW GIMME THE MOUSKA-TOOLS”. Mickey looked at the camera with a smile. “Mouska tools, Mouska tools, HERE ARE YOUR MOUSKA TOOOOOOLS!” They chanted. “LEts SeE” Mickey said. “Surgery scissors… Rubber glove, hoo-hoo… A gun… and The MYSTERYMOUSEKATOOL, it's a surprise tool that can help us later (hu-hu).” Goofy whispers in Mickey's ears. “How the fffflip are we going to use those?” Mickey didn’t answer. He walked over to Timmy. “Now kid, TELL ME YOUR NAME”. “Stoopid” Timmy repeated in his innocent voice. Mickey put both hands on his silly head and screamed demonically, then look at the camera. “Say, how do you think we are going to get this LITTLE FREAKING HOOLIGAN to talk?” Mickey paused so the audience can answer. “Thaaaaaaaaaaats right, the FIRST mouska-tool” Mickey grabbed Toodles again and ripped the first mouska-tool out of his screen. “Hu-hu, Surgery scissors.” Without hesitation, Mickey lunged at Donald and cut his beak off.  “WAAAAAAAAWRRHAWHWRHAWRHARHWARHAWHRWRHAWRHAWRHAHRAWH” Said Donald in a reasonable tone. “Owie, my earies!” Timmy said. “Now are you going to talk?” Mickey asked. Timmy replied with another “stupid”. Mickey punched Donald in the face to stop him from screaming. “Listen kid I know that's not your name” Mickey said. “I can just tell you his na-” “SHUT UP” Mickey interrupted Cheese again. “SECOND MOUSKA-TOOL please” Toodles tossed two blue doctor gloves at mickey. He slapped both of them on. With a menacing grimace, he walked towards Timmy. He wiggled his fingers in the gloves that were over his other gloves. He abruptly turned to Goofy and started squeezing his nose. “Uh, uh uh ACHOOOOO.” Goofy said. He didn’t sneeze, he just said that. His nose made a honking sound. Wonk wonk wonk wonk! Timmy screamed so loud, It shattered goofy's nose. “JUST TELL ME YOUR GOD *sighs* NAME!” Timmy said “poo-poo” and “stoopid” and “other things like that”. It was at that moment that Mickey decided to take out his third Mouska-tool. “Toodles, GET OVER HERE NOW.” Toodles was thrown in the garbage bin and tried to fly towards Mickey, but the bin flew with him. “GET THAT OFF YOU DUMB PIECE OF SHananigans” Mickey yelled. He took the can off of Toodles’ head and hit him with it. Mickey stopped hitting Toodles and looked at the camera. “Hu-hu, now, let's get our THIRD Mouska-tool.” Toodles barely made it off the ground and handed Mickey a gun. “Now let's try this ONE MORE TIME.” Mickey said. Toodles was finally able to get up until Mickey obliviously trampled him. “Alright KID, TELL ME YOUR NAME.” Timmy said “ho ho ho” The Cheese panicked and said “TIMMY! SAY YOUR NAME!” Mickey Shot the gun. A flag that said, “bang” shot out with the enthusiasm of teenagers being forced to sing camp songs. “Timmy,” Said Timmy in his usually Timmy-like fashion. Mickey was slightly less furious now. “Alright, enough games.” Mickey said. He turned around to pick up a mentally (and physically) destroyed Toodles. Mickey spoke to him formally. “Toodles my humble servant, give me THE MYSTERY MOUCKA_TOOL!”. “THE MYSTERY MOUSKA-TOOL!?” Goofy and Donald yelled at the same time. “YES,” Mickey said. Toodles began spinning around. It had arrived. Mickey said “The mystery mouska-tool is….” a rubbery blob emerged from toodles. “A USED CONDOM!?” Mickey yelled in confusion. *the frenchiest fry starts playing*. “Gorsh, I guess somebody was excited for hump day.” Goofy said. “Alright, DAISY, GET OVER HERE!” Mickey yelled. Instantly, Daisy Stumbled through the door. “Daisy, Find Minnie and bring her to ME.” Daisy walked back outside to find Minnie. Mickey had been placing a good bounty on Minnie despite her being right outside of his house. He looked at the camera. “Now AAAAlright, how do you suppose we use this- ew why is it torn, what the frick?” He tossed it on the floor but then realized it was part of the plan and picked it up. “Donald was this yours?” Mickey asked. “Uuuh, no?” Donald said. “We...uh… I have found the Minnie.” Daisy said. She tossed her on the floor in front of Mickey. “COME HERE, YOU” He, Goofy, and Donald pounced on Minnie mouse. Mickey got up while humming the “hot dog” song. He stretched out the mystery mouska tool and jumped in the air. Timmy and the Cheese teleported the heck out of there.
Timmy and The Cheese just sort of appeared in the next dimension. I bet you're wondering “Where are they now?”. Huh. Timmy Looked to the side. It appeared to be a strange ape in front of a blackboard. They walked over to it. The board said “sex ed clown” on it in white chalk letters. Timmy looked up at the clown. He had two “funny” looking puppets (hu-hu). “EvERYOnE LeaRNs iT EvEnTUalLY” The clown said and began giving chase. Nope nope nope not today. Timmy and The Cheese Teleported out of there.
    Now they were in some odd place.  It was not an alien planet, but it was not normal. Everything was pixely and weird. Timmy started digging down. The Cheese was an object. Cheese fell down the hole and Timmy picked it up. Its description said “A magically tasty snack.” Timmy said “MMMMM, YOM!” and ate his Cheese. That was not the actual Cheese. THE Cheese fell down the hole and Timmy picked it up. He equipped it as a pet and kept digging. Meanwhile, on the surface, a pixel person was walking and found the random hole. “Hey guys, come help me explore this hole.” He yelled back to his house. A gang of painters, wizards, nurses, and other people rushed over to join in. They all jumped down the hole. Now, Timmy had reached the bottom and was in the underworld, or as he called it, “the heck word.” Timmy had found a random Phamas the Caboose toy lodged in a rock. Timmy did not have a playset on him, so he just turned it on (*the frenchiest fry starts playing*). “I’m the number one tank engine” The train, ahem, caboose said. Timmy pressed a button on the back of the train. “Here I go” it said, and shot off into the distance with a rocket propellor. How did this company not get sued yet? The train came back and said “I have no idea where I’m going. Timmy played with the train for a while until the pixel guys came. “Get out of our world” said the main one. It took out a boomerang and tossed it at Timmy. When timmy was struck, he dropped the toy train. It landed in lava. “I’m the number 666 tank engine” a voice roared in the distance. “W-why do I hear boss music?” The player said. “Brace yourselves” The Cheese warned. The wall of train arose from a distance. It was blue, it had Phamas the Cabooses face on it. Two engine pumps above and below the face shot out smoke. 
“Run!” One of The Player’s  friends yelled. Everyone ran away from The Wall of Train. The Train head shot out more Phamas action figures. “HErE I cOmE!” echoed in the halls of The Heck Word. Timmy caught an action figure. “Now Timmy! Fire the train” Cheese yelled. Timmy fired the train at the ceiling. It broke through the roof, and probably launched into the sky. “Timmy, you idiot. YOU ARE GOING TO GET US KILLED!” Cheese yelled with aggravation. The Wall of Train approached. It roared. Suddenly, a bunch of “here I come ' ' ''s erupted from the sky. Trains rained from the ceiling and collapsed into The Wall of Train. The Wall sunk into lava, causing a massive explosion. The Player and his friends were knocked back. “Molly! Give me extra health!” The player yelled at his nurse friend. “That will be 5 gold” Molly said. “WE DON’T HAVE TIME FOR THIS, HEAL ME!”. “Sorry, I have principles.” “MOLLY YOU I- '' CRASH. They all hit the ground  and died. Some landed in lava. “Player1 didn’t bounce,” said the chat screen. Timmy had seen a lot of stuff. The Cheese directed him out of this dimension.
Now Timmy was sleeping in a bed. He woke up to a voice, his mom's voice. 
“My child,” Called the Mom “GET THE FRICK OUT OF BED, YOUR LATE FOR SCHOOL!” Timmy got up and didn’t put on his clothes (He already had them on), and went to the Bathroom. He flushed the toilet. A happy jingle played to celebrate his achievement! He flushed the toilet again, and again, and again. It was getting addicting. There was a knock at the door. “A-are you okay in there, my child?” The mom asked. Timmy kept flushing the toilet and his mom was getting worried. Eventually, he stopped and went outside without eating breakfast. His mom was by the car. His mom was a… goat person. “Who are you?” Timmy asked. “Oh, you know it's me, you silly goose. GET IN THE CAR!” His mom responded. Timmy’s REAL mom told him not to get in a car with another person he doesn’t know, but this wasn’t a person, it was a goat person. Timmy sat in the car as fanfare music played in the background. His mom drove recklessly throughout the town, she ran over people, bumped into the police officer, and rammed a teacher into a school building. Timmy’s eyes were wider than lacrosse balls. “Alright, let's head to school!”
 Timmy walked past the teacher, all squashed into the building, who looked like she had definitely seen some stuff, bad stuff. Timmy managed to escape his crazy mom and head to his classroom. Timmy noticed he had something in an inventory slot, it was The Cheese. Timmy pulled The Cheese out of his pocket. “AAAAHH! Oh thanks for saving me,” The cheese said, exasperated “somehow it smelt like sweat and chemicals AT THE SAME TIME.” Timmy walked into his classroom. Something was wrong. All of his classmates were anthropomorphic animals. There was a bird, a snake, a reindeer, and some cursed google images of catimages cat thingsthing. His teacher was the one rammed into the building by his mom's car, she looked ok, but still hadn’t made a full recovery. “Alright class, we’re doing a project” The teacher said “everyone choose your partners!” All of the kids instantly move to their partners. “Mrs. Teacher '' (she’s single) Timmy asked. The teacher looked over at him. “Dis Cheese is mah partner, '' Timmy said. “I’m sorry, but your partner can not be a piece of cheese.” The reindeer kid asked “where is my partner”. The teacher responded, “Noel you need to speak u-” BANG. The classroom door opened. Inside of it was a female Barney the dinosaur. “Am I late?” The Girl asked. “N-n-no, uh, You, cheese kid, you’re Susie’s partner.” Both of them were sent outside to find some chalk. Susie was smoking a stick of chalk. “Hey kid, you want one.” Timmy took it and said “MMMMMM, YOM!” and ate it. He started seeing things. rrrraaaaaiiiIIIIIIINNNNNNBBBBOOOOWWWWSSSS!!!!!!

Cheese had swapped dimensions before Timmy got any further in that trip. He was on a long, square road with triangles (most likely spikes) and large, floating orbs. The background had large hills that were striped. Some sick music was playing. Timmy went up to touch a spike. “Timmy, Stop!” Cheese warned. Timmy touched the spike, then he exploded with a comical ‘bang’ sound. “TIMMY!!!” Cheese yelled in terror, He gazed over the spike. “What?” Timmy said. “Ah!” screamed the Cheese. Timmy appeared right behind The Cheese and startled him. “Look, a robot!” Timmy yelled. A strange robot figure gracefully jumped over spikes and monsters. It landed on the spike Timmy had touched and it died, with the same explosion sound. They left. Timmy was in the middle of the ocean now.
    Cheese was melting. Timmy brought out his emergency, Littletike edition bucket. Timmy scooped cheeses liquid mass into the bucket. It was a b i g  b o y  b u c k e t . Timmy sealed the top of the bucket with a  B I G B O Y B U C K E T S E A L. Timmy swam downwards since there was nowhere else to go. Upbeat electronic music was playing in the background. Timmy decided not to drown and produce his own oxygen. He breathed like a fish. That's right, fish don’t brea- Then, Timmy saw a light. It was a submarine. They swam behind that submarine to find a way out. They instead found a large clam thing. It wapped at the submarine with its skinny, purple tentacles. Yes, this clam had tentacles, ew. It then ATE THE SUBMARINE, and they all lived happily ever after, accept for the guy in the submarine, he’s… he’s dead.
    The duo’s journey, however, was not over. They were on a stop-motion train set. A theme song started playing:


No lyrics were said, it just played a song. “Ooh! Ooh! I know! I know! It's the Phamas the Caboose show!” Timmy yelled. Phamas, the blue caboose motor, was chugging along on his railway. He arrived at a station booming with people. They were all standing still. A fat controller wearing a hat featuring a mouska-gang logo said “Attention, citizens, I am Sir Gang-symbol Hat” He looked like a rapper, but had the voice of an old British dude. “I have come to ship y’all drug cartels!” So this guy was still kind of a rapper. Phamas Chugged over to Gang-symbol hat.  He had many boxes in his back cart and more to come. Afterwards, He chugged off.
    Meanwhile, a trouble-maker (this means Gang-symbol doesn’t like him) named Joorgan was driving a few children around for “no reason in particular”. Gang-symbol hat was riding in his helicopter named Heck. Heck was flying around and reviewing the area when the fat controlla’ found someone running. It was a prisoner. The prisoner had escaped from Hat’s jail. “Catch that there idiot!” Sir gang-symbol hat grumbled to his crew. The crew did not really know what to do, so they handed their leader a revolver. Sir Gang-symbol hat tried to think of a cool quip but didn’t have anything and fired the gun fifteen times. They went in the direction of the prisoner but Joorgan accidentally drove in the way of the gunfire. Each shot was deflected and his Gang-symbol’s crew members. One somehow hit Heck’s rotors (lucky shot) and caused him to spiral out of control. “CURSE YOU JOORGAN!” Joorgan heard that and freaked out. When Gang-symbol hat gets mad, he tends to find the most painful way to destroy whoever caused that anger. Joorgan knew he had to escape, and fast.
    Heck and Gang symbol hat were fine, but the crew members were all DEAD. The fat controlla’ wanted revenge. Joorgan got a head start and hid in the urban areas of london. He wore a fedora and tux so that nobody noticed him (by the way, he’s a long and blue tank engine, there is no way somebody could not notice him.) Joorgan tipped his fedora down so that nobody saw his circular face. He went to the hair salon to get a new hairdo. The stylist climbed on top of Joorgan’s head and started spraying a brand of hair spray especially made for trains. Once he got his hair, he went to the tailor to fix up his tux (it was human sized and bursted when Joorgan tried to put it on.) His suit was good, his hair was good, now he just needed a hiding place. He booked into a cheap hotel and stayed in a room.  Sir gang-symbol hat can not find him here or he will be toast(ed in a train incinerator).    
    Sir gang-symbol hat, however, was already on the chase. He was riding on his prized trane, Emily. She was a train Gang symbol hat had taken hostage… in her own warehouse. Emily is now Gang-symbols personal servant. They chugged onward, to find where Jooorgan was hiding.
    Meanwhile, Phamas was shipping his cartel to the correct location. He came across Toby. Toby was a weird dude. He shipped wood… no really, he would ship pieces of wood together. “ ‘Oh I love you Bobby’ “ Toby said, pretending to be one piece of wood “ ‘ I love you too, Jessica ‘ “. He jammed the two blocks of wood together while making kissing noises. “Hi Toby… what are you up to this time?” Phamas asked. “I  just got Bobby and Jessica married!” Toby responded almost too eagerly. “Oh… o-ok“Well… uh… good luck with that… I guess?” Phamas replied. He was confused. Toby shipping wood was not a new thing though, it was just weird. He chugged along the railway to his destination.
    Joorgan was in his apartment, in his bed. He was thinking about What Sir Gang-symbol hat was going to do to him once he was caught. He would get sent to the pound and get crushed halfway and then get tossed into the lake where he will rot away until Gang-symbol hat gets bored, covers him in bread and feeds him to the ducks, or something like that. Either way, it's a grim fate to meet. A helicopter was heard outside. Joorgan hid in a closet. He saw Heck’s permanently smiling face go by the window. Heck stopped at the next window down. “Joorgan! We have found you!” Gang-symbol hat’s voice boomed from a radio. He heard a Gatling gun fire and a couple screams from the room. “Oops, nevermind, he must be elsewhere.” The helicopter flew off. When the coast was clear, Joorgan peaked through a bullet hole in his wall. In the room next to his, Heck fired off at the poor people inside, leaving a room full of bodies and an expensive clean up job. Gang-symbol hat knew Joorgan was here, all he needed was the right place to look. Joorgan had to escape before Heck and Gang-symbol came back.
    Phamas had been going quite a while without anybody getting in the way. He hoped to send this cartel before anybody else got in the way. “Hi Phamas! Have you heard du News?” Percy said as he jumped from behind a tree. Percy was one of Phamas’s friends, but he was a little weird. “AAH! Oh… what is it, Percy?”. “That JoOOOorgan guy is becoming… a convicted felon.” Percy said, breaking his excited tone when he said “convicted felon” . Phamas was not surprised this would happen. Joorgan was a bit of a jerk and it was a surprise he had not provoked Gang symbol hat yet. He continued along on his seemingly never ending journey. He crossed the long river bridge. His destination was up ahead.
    Meanwhile, Joorgan was running through the streets. He could not have any witnesses. He grabbed any man, woman, or child that made contact with him and tossed them in his back cabin. He chugged and chugged and chugged. He would be like the little blue engine accepting british and middle ages, if people actually kept track of that. He reached the entrance to the railroad. He then tossed the witnesses in the lake.      
    Emily, Gang-symbol hat’s enslaved assistant, was on the run. She had to get out of there without getting caught. She accidentally ran into Extender, the evil silver train.  He liked tormenting other trains in the area, specifically Emily. “HeY LitTLe GiRL” Extender yelled. “I don’t have time, Extender, get lost” She responded. Extender, as his name implies, can extend himself. He covered the track in front of Emily. “Hoo hoo, you’re not going anywhere.” Extender remarked. She was blocked off. Emily had a plan, however. She used her magnet (the one present in those little action figure trains) and pulled him backwards. His sideways wheels created sparks on the track. She hung him over the edge. “And stop calling me ‘little girl’” She said and dropped him into the lake. She quickly drove off of the bridge and onto flat land. She turned around to see what happened next. She could hear his last words. “Oh no-” BOOOOOOOM!  The bridge shattered and collapsed. Emily had forgotten that Extender was shipping contact bombs to Gang-symbol hat’s wearhouse. That didn’t matter, well, to her at least, the architects had to work twice their pay grade on this. She chugged off, hopefully to freedom. 
    Joorgan had heard a noise (Extenders blazing demise) coming from the bridge. He rushed over to make sure None of Hat’s gang members were coming. Instead he found that his favourite bridge was DEAD. He was sad now. The lake was destroyed too. He had nowhere to hide the witnesses. He chugged on back to the city. Suddenly, a light bulb hit him. It was not an idea, but an annoying teenager who tossed a light bulb at his head. Joorgan was mad. He chugged over to the kid and somehow broke the kids legs. He then tied the kid to a small tree by his hoodie. That gave him an idea. He quickly drove around town and started breaking some legs. Then, he brought them to different trees and tied them up there. He finally got a cement mixer and put the witnesses inside. They were made into a gooey material that was good for bridges. Joorgan called it “flesh”. He dried out the flesh in the sun until it was the texture of playdoh. He molded it into a bridge and placed it where the bridge used to be. Now he can access it anytime he wants again (he can deal with the paint job later). Now, He had to continue hiding from Gang symbol hat.
    Phamas Was nearing his destination. A giant demonic portal opened in front of him. He reluctantly chugged inside. A new theme song was playing:

🎵“ CHUGGINGTON! CHUGGINGTON!

CHUGGINGTON! CHU-GING-TON!

YOUR MOM’S AT THE DOOR!

CHUGGINGTON! CHUGGINGTON

CHUGGINGTON! CHU-GING-TON!

SHOW ME UNDER YOUR PA-!🎜”

The song was getting so annoying that Phamas tuned it out halfway through. It was also taking a vulgar turn. He Moved (the word “chug” was getting on his nerves) to a strange garage. He knocked on the door with his face. The door was opened by a strange green train. There was a red train and a blue train watching TV in the back. “GIMME DA BAG” The green train yelled. Phamas was a good train and decided to replace the drugs with crushed up doritos. The green train Snorted the dorito powder out of the bag. “Spicey!!!!” They yelled and shot forwards on the track. Phamas had to jump out of the way. She drove into an old woman [train]. The train was yelling something. “Haha! You really are a slowpoke-” BOOM. She drove into a wall and collapsed to the ground. Phamas was more concerned that she was able to taste the chips with her nose. He was freaked out either way. He found his portal again and went to another dimension.
    He found himself on a random railway. This place was bigger than that weird “Chuggington” trainyard. He saw a giant water tower with a face. He checked his clipboard. “Excuse me,” Phamas asked. The water tower turned around somehow and gave him an awkward look. It did not help that there was a 5 second loop of orchestra music playing in the background. “I am here to see… The little blue engine. It says here in parenthesis: ‘who thought he could'’” He continued. The water tower stared at him. Can she even talk? He thought. “Uh… hello?” He asked. “Aw yeah, he’s up that hill. I would go help him but, as you can see, I can’t move. Also it's fun to watch” she finally said “so, uh, yeah… up there.”. Phamas was chugging up the hill when he saw a clown with broken legs. “AAAHH! THIS WAS UNSCRIPTED!” The clown yelled. “Who are you” asked Phamas. “I’m the clown! I helped the train in the book when he ran over my foot. But in this cheap animated remake, HE RAN OVER MY LEGS AND DIDN’T COME BACK” he complained. Phamas tried to ignore the weird clown, he doesn’t like clowns in general, and drove off. “Hey! Mr. BLUE ENGINE! WAIT UP!” Called Phamas  “a blue engine with a beard turned around. “What is it?” he asked. “I have… a delivery for you.” Phamas handed the bag over. The blue engine looked in it. “Ooh, my powdered chips arrived, thanks.” he said. He poured the crushed doritos in his mouth, tossed the bag to the side, and chugged up the hill rapidly. Phamas forgot he had purposely swapped the drugs with powdered doritos when the little blue engine shot off the hill farting out rainbows.  Phamas went back to the portal home. Joorgan was preparing for Gang symbol hat’s return. Things were getting grim, but Joorgan knew there was something that could stop him. 
    That same day, the Toby guy from earlier was hosting a “christmas special” with his wood. He decided to celebrate by flying around with his wood like Santa's sleigh, because apparently he could do that. He flew up, spreading christmas wood all around the junction even though it was May. Phamas had chugged by, trying to ignore him. “Hey phamas!” Toby yelled. Phamas had no choice now. “What is it?” Phamas responded. “Recently, I have been hearing strange noises up in the sky”  Phamas thought Toby was going crazy, but then he heard something in the sky. 
A helicopter. He somehow turned around on his train tracks (this shouldn’t be physically possible while on rails) and saw a helicopter flying around above the landscape. Phamas squinted his anthropomorphic train eyes. He saw Sir Gang symbol hat flying in his helicopter, Heck. Heck had a permanent grin on his face as he scanned the railroads, probably searching for a new victim. But they were on the hunt for Joorgan, who was still on the run. “We are going to find you, Joorgan, and make you pay the price!” Hat’s voice boomed from Heck’s radios. Phamas was worried. It had already been lonely on this island, he didn’t want to lose another colleague! He turned back around to find Toby was missing. Great, Phamas thought. He chugged back to the station and Gang Symbol Hat was still on the hunt. Joorgan must be good at hiding! Phamas was prepared to just sleep when he heard Toby screaming… in the sky. He looked up and Saw Toby, riding in his christmas Sleigh (it is still May.) and charged right at Heck. “We have located you, Joorgan, Prepare to…- what in the name of friend tomatoes is that!?” Gang Symbol Hat and heck  were distracted by tobay, flying around and stuff. Heck pulled out a pair of not so cartoony gatling guns and fired at Toby. Toby maneuvered around the tiny bullets and got closer. Heck was helpless to stop Toby at this point. Toby’s sleigh was a few meters from Heck when he said “Merry Christmans, sucker” and dismounted the sleigh mid-air. 
The large hunk of metal and presents crashed into Heck and he spiraled out of control. “AHHH! Do something you pile of junk!” Gang Symbol yelled, punching the controls. Hecks propeller flew out the top. “Why is that a function? Dammit!” Gang symbol hat yelled. Toby landed as gracefully as a train could on the rails and Heck pummeled into the ground. Joorgan Jumped out of a nearby bush. “What happened? Am I dead!?” He yelled. “No, you aren’t dead Joorgan” Phamas said. Toby chugged over to his wood collection. Joorgan Went over to The helicopter to make Sure Gang Symbol hat was dead. Finally, Phamas went back to the station to take a well deserved nap. Where was Emily? Nobody knows. She is probably selling Gang symbol hat’s stuff or something.
Timmy sat there with his mouth wide open. The Cheese would have also if he had a mouth. “Wh… what just happened!?” He yelled. They just had their roles in this story overthrown by some stop motion trains. They were sitting on the train station, so all they really saw was a demonic portal opening and a flying train crashing into a creepy helicopter. They stood there in silence, acknowledging what they witnessed. “Ooh! Ooh! I know!” Timmy yelled “that was the Phamas the Caboose show!”. “You just noticed that?” Cheese asked. The cheese was still trying to piece together everything he just witnessed. It didn’t matter, on to the next dimension.
    They arrived on a grassy plain. In Front of them was a massive Grey cube that said “THE FANDOM” on it in green letters. Timmy slowly walked up to the bastion building. They had nowhere else to go. The cheese hopped onto Timmy’s Shoulder. This was going to be a whole new adventure

Chapter 3 - Fandoms below

Timmy and The Cheese walked into the large building to find a large room full of halls and doorways. The building seemed much larger on the inside than on the outside. Timmy noticed a Woman sitting on a large podium. When they walked in, everybody looked at them. Timmy looked at everyone “I haven’t gotten these kinds of looks since I walked in on Jimmy’s parents-” “Greetings, newcomers!” The woman said into a microphone “We need you to log in before you can go anywhere.” The tossed a clipboard down from the platform she was on. Timmy didn’t catch it, but it floated in his hand. It had some personal information fo him to fill out:

NAME: Timmy Fluberson

Birthdate: 1800

Age: 6

Sex: hehe

Sexuality: sauerkraut

Password: *******

The Cheese looked at the info with confusion, but didn’t judge. Timmy blindly tossed the clipboard back at the platform. He missed and it landed in the crowd. “I got this childs info, Hell yeah!” somebody yelled. Timmy ignored them. “Welcome to the fandom!” The woman said. She pointed at two giant grey gates that Timmy didn’t notice before. The doors opened with a creak. “Before you enter, just know that- aaaand they’re gone” The Fandom leader tried to say before Timmy and the Cheese went through the gates. It didn’t matter, she had business of her own to attend to. 
    Timmy and The Cheese were perplexed by the size and complexity of the place. It was full of rooms. Timmy likes rooms. He often heard his parents being told to get a room. The Cheese was reading a page about what is in this place. “Ok, Timmy,  there is where the hotel rooms are.” The cheese looked at Timmy “Timmy?” He was missing. The Cheese searched around to find Timmy looking at a person who was drawing. He hopped over to Timmy and noticed what the person was drawing. “Ew! Timmy, don’t look at that.” The person drawing turned around. “Do you mind!?” they yelled. We won’t describe what the drawing was, just know it was bad for Timmy’s eyes. You see, Timmy has a very clean soul. He may do weird things, but he has good intentions (because he’s a little kid and stuff.) his soul is so clean that it can wash dishes if he ate them. The Cheese didn’t want it tainted. He walked Timmy back to the hotel rooms where they could take a load off
    The hotel room was clean and big, just the right size to fit Timmy and his Cheese. The cheese had a nice king size bed to sleep in. Timmy got a tiny bed with rocket ships on it. The Cheese decided he needed a bath (do cheeses take baths?) he plopped into the bathtub and Filled it with melted cheese. Not questioning the fact that he was basically bathing in liquidated flesh, he lounged in there for a good while. His moment of peace was broken when Timmy kicked the bathroom door down “DOOT DOOT DOOT DOOT!” Timmy yelled. The cheese submerged himself under the… cheese... only to be grabbed by Timmy “it's adventure time! Come on, grab your friends!” The Cheese was about to point out he had no friends but realized Timmy was being “cliche”. Timmy ran out the door and into the hall and out of the hall and into the main room and out of the main room and into the- “where are we going!?” The cheese yelled. Timmy stopped and thought about it. “Art room!” he said, running towards the fan art area. The Cheese sighed, this was not how he wanted his break to go.
    The Fandom Leader walked up to a room that said “WEiRd FanDOm” on it. One of her side jobs, along with managing the fandom, was coaching weird fandom members in the ways of being normal. When she entered the room, chaos was afoot. There were about 5 people she was currently coaching. One had a shirt with a picture of a stick figure eating another stick figure and said “yum” on it. The second’s shirt had a picture of a disturbingly realistic foot that said “yum” on it too. The third had a picture of a person in a bikini that said, you guessed it, “yum”. The Fandom leader was unsure why they found these things so tasty. The fourth and fifth were an anthropomorphic wolf person and an anthropomorphic pony. The fandom leader sat down in a chair at the end of the long table everyone was at. “Ok guys… uh…” she said, but noticed the person with the foot shirt was missing. She quickly looked under the table to find them crawling under and trying to take people’s shoes off. “Hey! Get back in your seat!” she yelled. The person instantly appeared in their chair. “Ok, for today, try to draw a painting that does NOT contain any of your... kinks.” She instructed. The Fandom leader deeply regretted taking this job, but nobody else would take it so she has no other option. They all started drawing stuff. The two anthropomorphic animals were pretty normal, she thought, who sent them down here? “Your drawing sucks!” The pony suddenly yelled. “Oh yeah!?” the wolf responded and licked the pony's face. The Pony looked traumatized. “AAAAAHHHH!!” they yelled, running around the room. The wolf laughed to themself. “Calm down” The Fandom leader said. “he licked me!! Eww!” the pony yelled. The Fandom leader sighed, this was going to be a long day.
    Timmy and The Cheese had entered the “art and fan art” room and were looking at some of the drawings. These were some weird pictures. One had a buff piece of cheese on it. The Cheese was impressed, but then he saw some stranger things. There was a comic with Timmy and The Cheese in it. For some reason, Timmy looked twice his age (more like 3 times his age). “Hey… cheese” Comic Timmy said. “T-Timmy…” The comic cheese said. The next panel was comic Timmy bending over. “What are you doing, step-chee-” “OK I think that's enough fun for today” the cheese said, dragging Timmy away from the strange drawings “But what was gonna happen?” Timmy asked. The images here were cursed, and not in a funny way. Some of them seemed to disregard age, species, or life-and-death status and just had people… loving each other… aggressively. The cheese still didn’t judge. 
    The cheese had managed to drag Timmy all the way back to the hotel room. Cheese resumed his bath. It was almost peaceful until some naked dude ran into his bathroom had just kept saying “e” over and over. Cheese had screamed for about a full minute when the mod-bots came in to get him. Those mod-bots were sometimes annoying, but they got rid of people like that spammer with relative ease. 
    After the long bath, the cheese had noticed it was dark outside. Timmy was asleep on the floor. Looking at the night sky, the cheese remembered the whole point of travelling out of earth was to find a more suitable dimension to live in, and this place might just be it. The cheese went over to his bed, and started to sleep, noting the bed smelled like cheese...
    “Look, cheese, its santa!” Timmy suddenly yelled. The cheese found himself on a large sleigh, similar to that of santa’s. Despite the sleigh being open to the sky, it smelled like a car somebody had been smoking in. The cheese got up “where are we!?” he yelled. “... Santa!” Timmy said again. The cheese looked over the front seat on the sleigh. A weird fat dude dressed as santa. He turned around. “I- *BURP” he said “I am saanta… with 3 a’s…”.  “what?” The cheese asked. “ I am saanta…” he said again “with 3. A’s.” That time, he put an emphasis on each letter. “That totally answers my question” the cheese said. “Santa!” Timmy yelled again. The 3 sat there in silence. Suddenly, Santa with 3 a’s opened his mouth to talk “MAh name’s saanta… with 3 a’s!” he said. This was getting annoying. “Is that the only thing you say!?” The cheese yelled. “No.” Santa with 3 a’s responded quickly. 
    Eventually, the sleigh arrived at a factory building that said “Santa’s workshop” with one a painted over. Saanta with 3 a’s turned around to speak. “Let me guess” the Cheese interrupted “your name is saanta with 3 a’s?”. Saanta with 3 a’s shook his head “Actually, I was gonna say we arrived at our destination *BURP*”. He kicked the two out of his sleigh. “Oh and one last thing” saanta with 3 a’s said “My name’s saanta with 3 a’s”. Before cheese could yell in rage, the sleigh flew off and exploded. “Santa! No!” Timmy yelled. The cheese dragged Timmy into the factory. Maybe somebody that could help was in there.
    When they entered, another Santa was inside. “Santa!” Timmy yelled. “Bring me the ho ho ho’s!” the Santa yelled, but turned around to find Timmy and the cheese in the doorway. “Oop, nevermind, there are children here.” This santa looked a lot more hip and a lot less drugged than the previous one. “Hello, kids, my name is Snta with 1 A!”. oh dear god” The cheese said. Snta with 1 A walked over to them, his gold chain clanking. “Don’t worry, I am not as annoying as my brother Saanta with 3 a’s!” he reassured them. “Of course, there is also my other brother, Saantaa with 4 a’s, but he couldn’t make it… out…. Alive.” his face turned grim. The cheese thought this guy was maybe a little sane until he saw the machinery behind him. There were conveyor belts loading piles of teenagers into unseen rooms. “Uh… what's with the...uh… machinery behind you?” the cheese asked. Snta turned around like he didn’t even know it was there. “Ah, yes, that is my loading station, where I prepare all the little girls and boys to be shipped to the toys!” he said. The Cheese was very confused. “Uh… I think you are supposed to be shipping the toys to the kids” The cheese said. “Bah, it all works out the same one way or another” he replied “oh look, here comes my next shipment now.” The three looked behind themselves to see a flying white van enter a docking station nearby. It unloaded some more teenagers that were tied up with rope. “Wait… you kidnap them!?” The cheese yelled, shocked. “Well yeah, how else do I get them?” Snta replied “you got a problem with that?” One girl had managed to roll off of the conveyor belt. Suddenly, a robotic hand came from the ceiling. “Tickle tickle tickle.” the hand said in a robotic voice. The hand just picked the girl up and plopped them back on the conveyor belt. “Anyways” Snta with 1 a said “it was nice talking with you, now it's time to unveil my ultimate plan!” Timmy likes plans and ultimate things. He looked over to a curtain. “This is my black hole creator...intator…” he said. “You built that?” the cheese asked. “No” snta responded “I actually stole it from some weird german dude, but that doesn’t matter!”. The black hole creator inator looked like some weapon of mass destruction, which it was. “It's a funny gunny,” Timmy said. “This gunny isn’t very funny” Snta said “It can eat entire dimensions!” Just as Snta was about to activate it, somebody showed up at the door.
    “Fandom police! Put your hands in the air” the people yelled. “We are getting rescued!” Timmy yelled. Snta with 1 A was prepared. “Don’t make me use this,” he yelled. “Drop the black hole creator inator!” one officer yelled. Snta prepared to activate it. “Say goodbye, everyone!” Snta yelled. He pressed the activate button.
    Nothing happened… until something happened! Suddenly, a large black hole emerged at the tip of the inator. “Now I will absorb everything in this dimension!” Snta yelled. The Cheese had to get out of here. “Timmy?” he asked, looking for Timmy. He found Timmy sticking the end of the inator in his mouth. “Timmy! No!” The Cheese yelled. Timmy was about to eat the black hole. After a long bit of waiting, A bright Glow shined from inside of timmy. Snta was confused “wait wha-” Suddenly, with an echoing fart sound, the world was absorbed…
    Timmy was in a dark void. So dark that he all he could see was D A R K. “That was a tasty black hole” Timmy said. He saw eyes in front of him. Deep, red, staring eyes. Timmy didn’t recognise them at first, but then he did. “Wait.. are you my-?” Timmy tried to say before getting cut off by existence. 

Chapter 4: Into the Cheeseverse

Now, Timmy was back in The Fandom Room… but how? “Sorry everyone” The fandom leader yelled through a loudspeaker “We had to perform our anti-blackhole protocol… alongside our anti-invader protocol, anti-bot protocol, anti-spammer protocol, anti… why is there an anti-furry protocol? Who put that there!?” Timmy found The Cheese laying next to him. “What happen” he said, not asked. “I don’t know” The Cheese responded “I think we got teleported here somehow.” A massive garage door opened behind the two. “Wait.. are we flying?” The Cheese asked. He went over to the big door and looked at the moving sky. “I think we are flying”  The cheese answered himself. “The fandom room is officially flying!” The fandom leader said. Timmy got the sneaking suspicion that they were flying. “We are expecting visitors soon, so please do not mess the place up” the fandom leader said through a loudspeaker
